My name is ZHANG Haoyu. I will be starting as a Master's Year 2 (M2) student in mathematics at Universit√© Paul Sabatier, currently interested in analysis and dynamical systems in particular. 

I had the privilege of participating in the Yunnan University-Fudan University 2+2 Joint Program during my undergraduate studies. This experience provided me with earlier exposure to various branches of mathematics and helped me discover my passion, though I have confronted with significant challenges along the way.
